        Monroe County and Bloomington city government are planning the
        construction of a
        <u>new, bigger jail.</u>
      </h1>
      <div class="title-info">
        <p>
          In the winter of 2022, the county's plan was to buy 87 acres of land
          ($10+ million) by Fullerton Pike, and build a large jail complex
          ($50-60 million), with plans to expand the facility in later years.
          They said they'd eventually move the entire justice system to this
          remote property, costing even more taxpayer money.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            The city government rejected the rezone of that property, with the
            support of a large local movement, all arguing that the plan was
            poorly thought out and that it was cruel to move struggling people
            out of sight and out of mind, far away from the city center.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          This process is moving quickly right now, as a debate emerges in the
          county government about whether it's worth investing significantly in
          improving conditions for the people in the jail <strong>now</strong>,
          vs. saving those funds for a remote and "treatment-focused" jail in
          the future.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
          The new sherriff recently made the news, in late January 2023, by
          publicizing the disgusting conditions in the jail, asking for money to
          immediately to clean things up after years of county neglect.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>
            Unfortunately, the county commissioners, (Lee Jones, Julie Thomas,
            and Penny Githens), are less interested in cleaning things up now,
            than moving full steam ahead toward a new jail.

            What would it cost to fix the current jail? No detailed cost
            estimates have been done, and it doesn't make sense to move forward
            without this information.

            What steps can they take to have fewer people in jail? How can we
            make the monroe county jail less traumatizing and more rehabilitive?
            The Monroe County Commissioners pushing this expansion have refused to center these questions.

        Local addiction & mental health services, (especially grassroots
        organizations representing the people most affected) do not have enough
        funding. The county is choosing a punitive approach to a community
        health issue, while they neglect to address notoriously bad conditions
        in the jail itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bottom line is that putting struggling people in cages, and branding
        them with a criminal record to cut them off from housing and employment,
        makes life harder for everyone.

        We're working on doing whatever it takes to get our tax dollars to fund
        care instead of more cages. We meet every thursday 6-7 at the Overlook
        Community Center (611 W 12th St.), and you can reach us at
