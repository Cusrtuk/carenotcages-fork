        monroe county and city government are planning to build
        <u>a new, bigger jail</u>
      </h1>
      <p>
        They're about to buy 87 acres of land ($10+ million) by Fullerton Pike,
        and build a large facility ($50-60 million), with more construction in
        the future. They're also talking about building a new juvie there.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          They plan to use money from the recent income tax increase to fund the
          project.</strong

        <strong>Before</strong> spending $70 million, we think the City and

            What would it cost to fix the current jail? No serious cost
            estimates have been done, and it doesn't make sense to move forward
            without this information.

        Local addiction & mental health services, (especially grassroots
        organizations that don't work closely with the police) don't have enough
        funding. Housing and food is only getting more expensive here.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bottom line is that putting struggling people in cages, and branding
        them with a criminal record to cut them off from housing and employment,
        makes life harder for everyone.

        The solutions to "crime" are already here, and just need the real

        We're working on doing whatever it takes to get our tax dollars to fund
        care instead of more cages. We meet every thursday 6-7 at the Overlook
        Community Center (611 W 12th St.), and you can reach us at
        carenotcages.moco@gmail.com
