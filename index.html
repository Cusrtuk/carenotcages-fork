        Monroe County and Bloomington city government are planning the
        construction of a
        <u>new, bigger jail.</u>

          The county is about to buy 87 acres of land ($10+ million) by
          Fullerton Pike, and build a large facility ($50-60 million), with more
          construction in the future. They're also talking about building a new
          juvie there.

            What would it cost to fix the current jail? No serious cost
            estimates have been done, and it doesn't make sense to move forward
            without this information.

        Local addiction & mental health services, (especially grassroots
        organizations that don't work closely with the police) do not have
        enough funding. The cost of living is quickly getting more expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bottom line is that putting struggling people in cages, and branding
        them with a criminal record to cut them off from housing and employment,
        makes life harder for everyone.

        We're working on doing whatever it takes to get our tax dollars to fund
        care instead of more cages. We meet every thursday 6-7 at the Overlook
        Community Center (611 W 12th St.), and you can reach us at
